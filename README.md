# Stable Diffusion on EEG Signals
Using Stable Diffusion on the DEAP Dataset (http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/) to argument new data and improve classification 

**Problem Statement**: 
Is it possible to get better classification performance by using an augmented 
dataset generated by a probabilistic diffusion model?



This research is aimed to answer the following **research questions**:
1. Are diffusion based approaches better than other augmentation models, for example GANâ€™s
2. Which features are more suitable for a diffusion model basd data augmentation approach?
3. What are good features to classify EEG signals, with respect to feature importance
